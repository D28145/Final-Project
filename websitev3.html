                This website explores the major communication technologies invented after 1877, highlighting their relevance and impact on society. From the telephone to cell phones, each technological advancement has revolutionized the way we communicate, shaping the modern world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Communicative Technology has been pivotal in shaping the history of the United States. It has enabled instant and widespread communication thereby fueling social and economic progress and laying the groundwork for subsequent technological breakthroughs that have collectively revolutionized society.
            </p>
            <p>
                Communicative technology has played a critical role in United States history. Made by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, the telephone has changed how people communicate over long distances. It replaced slower ways like letters and telegraphs. This made it easier for people and businesses to stay in touch. It helped businesses grow by making coordination and customer service better. Not but a few years later, the radio was invented in the early 20th century allowing for mass communication to broadcast news, music, and sports. Radios were the first means of communication that could reach millions of United States citizens with news, entertainment, and emergency info, bringing the nation together especially during times like World War II.
            </p>
            <p>
                Invented by Philo Farnsworth in 1927, the television changed communication forever by bringing the visual side of communication to life, allowing homes to own their piece of the theater in their living room. It affected culture, politics, and social norms. It became a major way for advertising and public messages. The internet, which started from ARPANET in the 1960s to the World Wide Web in the 1990s, completely changed how people could communicate and access data globally, making communication and data accessible almost instantaneously. It impacted industries, education, and social interactions a lot. Finally, we have the mobile phone beginning with Martin Cooper's invention in 1973 made communication even easier allowing for communication on the go anywhere at anytime. Modern smartphones combined internet access, GPS, and applications to make a necessary tool for ease of life. The advancements of these technologies have paved United States History helping social and economic growth leading to the America we have today.

                Alexander Graham Bells invention in 1876 revolutionized personal and business communication. Before the telephone, there was a reliance on slower methods of communication like letters and telegraphs. The revolutionary invention of the telephone allowed for us to instantly communicate over long distances, this completely changed how people and businesses communicated and interacted.<sup>1</sup> This technological breakthrough helped businesses by allowing for the growth of customer service and coordination amongst its staff across long distances. The telephone overall laid the foundation for the future of global telecommunications networks, this influenced the subsequent communicative technologies that we will visit later on.<sup>2</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                The telephone did not only allow for incredibly fast communication but it also transformed the economic and social environment of the times. It allowed for the growth of suburbs enabling people to live farther from their place of work. this in turn influenced urban planning.<sup>3</sup>  The creation of the telephone also allowed for emergency services of the time to be more effective, greatly increase response times and saving more lives. <sup>4</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                The telephone industry itself also became an incredibly massive sector for the United States, creating jobs and increasing technological advancements that led to the creation of other communicative devices.<sup>5</sup> The transition from operator-based systems to automatic switching systems revolutionized the efficiency and reliability of the telephone.<sup>6</sup> Overall the telephones impact of everyday life was like not other, and it changed how people interacted professionally and socially forever.<sup>7</sup>
